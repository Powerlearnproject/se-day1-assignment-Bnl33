Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is a branch of engineering that is associated with the development of software products using well defined scientific procedures, methods and principles.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Mastering Productivity (2002-2010) - this includes Customer Involvement and Customer Productivity in the Agile Period using MDA and XP Methodologies
Mastering Complexity ( 1983-1992) - this includes Reusing new programming approach in the Object Oriented Period using Modern, SSADM Methodologies
Mastering Communications (1993-2001) - this includes integrated method quality in the Distributed Period using CORBA Methodologies



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Idea Generation - defining the project scope, goals and timeline
Requirement Analysis - gathering detailed user needs and functionalities
Product Design - creating the software architecture 
Product Development - writing the actual software code
Integration and Testing - carrying out tests to identify errors and fix bugs
Deployment - distributing the completed software to the intended users
Maintenance - doing updates,fixing bugs and improvements to the software


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The Waterfall Methodology is a linear, sequential process with distinct phases whereas Agile Methodology uses iterative cycles
Waterfall is less flexible while Agile is more flexible in that it embraces change and allows adjustments
In Waterfall, customer feedback is gathered at the end of the development cycle while in Agile customer engagement is encouraged throughout the whole process

Scenarious where Waterfall is appropriate include projects that involve high detailed documentation and projects with clear timelines
Scenarious where Agile is appropriate include projects where flexibility is important and projects where rapid and continuous customer feedback is important


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A Software Developer solves any technical problems emerging during the development lifecycle. A Quality Assurance Engineer spots functional and non-functional defects and makes sure an application performs according to requirements. A Product Manager makes sure a product is delivered on time and within budget and manages and motivates the Software Development Team



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Intergrated Development Environments boosts developer productivity, decreases installation time and accelearates development activities and helps programmers develop software code efficiently such as Visual Studio Code. Version Control Systems helps manage the source code for the software team, facilitates team collaboration, improved efficiency and improves productivity by making the development process smooth such as Github.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Changing Software Requirements - how to overcome ->engineers can adapt to approaches such as Agile Methodology 
Software Testing Conflicts- how to overcome -> Open communication and Collaborative Planning
Software Accessibility and Usability -> engineers must test and monitor software thoroughly before and after launching


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing is the process where you test the smallest functional unit of code. It helps developers identify and fix issues early
Integration Testing is the process of testing the interface betweeen two software units or modules. It exposes faults in the interaction between intergrated units
System Testing involves evaluating the overall functionality and performance of a complete software solution. It checks the systems'sfunctionality to fulfill all the business requirements 
Acceptance Testing is checking if the product meets business requirements and is what the customer wants. It confirms the sotware's stability and checks for flaws

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering is the process of crafting an instruction in order to produce the best possible output from a generative artificial intelligence model. A fun way of "talking to AI"  


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Tell me about the guy who invented the light bulb- Vague Prompt
Can you provide more details on Thomas Edison's invention of the light bulb - the Improved Prompt
The improved one enhances specificity towards the information one is seeking
